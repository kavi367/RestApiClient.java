This task is very usefyl for me and I learned much in this program.I used visual studio and some online website java compiler to see the output for this java program. As part of Task 2 in the internship, I created a Java program named RestApiClient.java. This program acts as a REST API client that connects to an external public API using Java's built-in networking classes like HttpURLConnection.

The API I used was Agify.io, which predicts a person's age based on their name. The program sends a GET request, receives a JSON response, and prints it to the console. I wrote and tested this code in Visual Studio Code and also verified the output using online Java compilers.

This task helped me understand how to use Java for web communication, how REST APIs work, and how to handle API responses in real time. It was a new and valuable learning experience for me. And I had used to clear my doubts by seeing java materials and some videos. So finally, tis task is very useful for me.
